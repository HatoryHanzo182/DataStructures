## Introduction

DataStructures is a C++ library that provides implementations of various data structures commonly used in computer science and programming. It aims to be a helpful resource for understanding data structures and their operations.

The library includes the following data structures:
- Dynamic Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Hash Table
- Graph

Each data structure is implemented with a clear and concise interface, and the code is written in C++ for ease of use and understanding.

## Features

- Implementation of common data structures
- Clear and concise interface for each data structure
- Well-documented code with explanations of algorithms and operations
- Easy-to-understand examples of usage

## Installation

To use the DataStructures library, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone.
```

2. Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler.

3. Include the necessary header files in your own C++ project to use the data structures.

## Usage

To use the DataStructures library, include the corresponding header files in your C++ project. For example, if you want to use the Dynamic Array data structure, include the "DynamicArray.h" header file:

```cpp
#include "DynamicArray.h"

// Your code using the Dynamic Array data structure
```

Refer to the documentation and examples provided for each data structure to learn how to use them effectively in your code.
